# BasicWeatherAppIOS

A basic weather app using Objective-C for Winter 2016 iOS v Android Workshop hosted by Women Who Code and ChickTech.

This project served as the foundation for a 2 hour presentation for beginners. 
Slides of the presentation can be found here: 
https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nQ6lpclnDxTyXvNgV46W1xboY-4l6col9Np0VpRByOU/edit?usp=sharing

Use each branch to demo a step in creating a basic weather app using the Forcast.io API.

*EDIT*\n

The Master branch has been updated to include Step 9 which we did not cover in the presentation. 

Step 9 creates a Forcast** class, introduces multithreading into the project, creates a waiting screen while data is loading, and uses the device's current location to propagate weather.
Top tip:  use the simulator and change the coordinates to display weather from all over the world. Debug > Location > Custom Location

If anyone is interested in reviewing Step 9 please contact me and I'm happy to explain it: @annelindsley everywhere there is to contact peeps. 

If you'd like to view the complete project from the presentation please look at the Step 8 branch.

**please forgive the typo in the Forcast class name, yes, it should be Forecast.
